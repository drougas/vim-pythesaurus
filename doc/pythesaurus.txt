INTRODUCTION                                                *pythesaurus*

This plugin provides a command for looking up words on http://thesaurus.com/

The plugin displays the definition of the word under the cursor and a list of
synonyms.

The credit for the original idea and (some of the) code goes to Anton
Beloglazov (http://beloglazov.info) and Nick Coleman
(http://www.nickcoleman.org/).

MAPPINGS                                           *pythesaurus-mappings*

                                                 *:PyThesaurusCurrentWord*
The plugin provides the |:PyThesaurusCurrentWord| command to look up the
current word under the cursor in an online thesaurus.

                                                                  *:PyThesaurus*
Alternatively, you can look up any word with |:PyThesaurus|:
>
  :PyThesaurus word
<
Internally, both commands make a request to http://thesaurus.com/, parse the
results, and display them in a vertical split in the bottom.

CUSTOMIZATION                                 *pythesaurus-customization*

                                                 *g:online_thesaurus_map_keys*
You can map the |:PyThesaurusCurrentWord| command to anything you
want as follows:

  nnoremap <your key binding> :PyThesaurusCurrentWord<CR>
